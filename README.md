# Museum API Project Week 4

Hey! This is my first website using Harvard Museum's API functionality to import data regarding many important pieces of art.

I utilized setState quite a bit, as well as useEffect and async functions to make calls to the API.
I had some problems with some paintings/records not having images, artists, or dates so I decided to use conditional logic to filter out those works that didn't have any of those categories.
Also utilized recursion to iterate through pages of json response.
Utilized flexboxes to make the data look nice, as well as custom CSS.
Imported images from the API.
Only showing latest not wanted categories because it looks much better than showing the complete list all at the time.
Also, utilized a dictionary with the json key's as the dict key and stored values in lists for each key. This was useful to then loop through the keys and check if the attributes from a record had that attribute already in the Not Wanted list.
